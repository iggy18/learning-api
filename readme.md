#  this is a practice run for an api project

I'm beefing up my knowledge of Django REST Framework to build an api.


this project will have lots of comments because it is not is a study case and not intended for production.


I'll be using a docker container and Travis CI for practice as well.


my next project will be a school admin system that uses django REST framework as the back end, and React as the Frontend. I'm gearing up for that.
